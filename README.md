# Learning Rust via Ruby

### A text-based adventure game being built in Rust and Ruby (simultaneously)

The Rust version of the game is still being built, but if you want to play the Ruby game:

1. clone this repository
2. cd into it (i.e. enter `cd learning-rust` in your terminal)
3. enter `ruby lib/adventure_game.rb` in your terminal and hit return
4. play :)

The actual narrative of the story will change - currently it is very simplistic while we're building it. By September, it will be completely different, but if you *want* to play it right now, you can.

Rust side mostly built by @wycats (so far), Ruby side mostly built by @lizbaillie (so far).
