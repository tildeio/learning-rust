# Learning Rust via Ruby

### A text-based adventure game being built in Rust and Ruby (simultaneously)

If you want to play it:

1. clone this repository
2. cd into it (i.e. enter `cd learning-rust` in your terminal)
3a. for the Ruby version: enter `ruby lib/adventure_game.rb` in your terminal and hit return
3b: for the Rust version: enter `cargo run` in your terminal and hit return
4. play :)

The actual narrative still needs to be ported over & some prettifying still needs to happen, but you can play a super simplistic placeholder game right now.

Built mostly by @lizbaillie with help from @wycats
